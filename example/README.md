# Examples

This folder contains some examples to show how the `accessibility` package could be used. In particular:

  - the `basic/` example teach you how to use the `accessibility` package in the most simple way;
  - the `with_multiple_languages/` example teach you how to use the `accessibility` package to support multiple languages;
  - the `with_custom_ui/` example teach you how to use the `accessibility` package to use your Widgets instead of the package ones to change accessibility settings. Inside the `widgets/custom/` folder you can find the custom widgets used in the example to change accessibility settings.

In whatever way you want to use `accessibility` package, it will always be mandatory to initialize the components described in the *Usage* chapter in the main README.
